Welcome to my project!

Here you will find a Soccer Team Simulator that allows you to create a team and begin your journey in the super league!

First:
You will input your name and the name of the team you created using "City", "Name" format.
This helps to create a user-friendly intro and will begin your journey to glory!

Second:
The program will simulate the regular season standings and print a table.
The table will be organized with the first tier league rankings according to overall record and goal difference
Following this the program will simulate the playoffs!

The following is the code used to simulate the playoffs following the regular season.
The code prints off the results of the Quarter-Finals, Semi-Finals, and Final match as well as the winner of the league
according to the playoffs.

Afterward the code simulates the second tier league rankings according to overall record and goal difference
This will also determine who will be promoted/ relegated.

To be promoted you must have finished within the top 3 spots of the second division, those teams will be promoted to
the first division.
Relegation will occur to the teams who finish as the bottom 3 in the first division, those teams will be dropped down to
the second division and hope to be promoted the following season.

Once all of that has been completed the code will then ask you if you would like to continue!
Doing so will advance the program into the next season with the updated year and table while still using the same team
you had created.
Should you decide not to advance the program will end and thank you for trying it out!
However, if you just want to start over with a new team, restarting the program will do just that!
